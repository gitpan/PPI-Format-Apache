NAME
    PPI::Format::Apache - mod_perl hook for perl syntax highlighting

SYNOPSIS
        # In httpd.conf
        PerlModule PPI::Format::Apache
        <Files ~ "\.pm$">
            SetHandler perl-script
            PerlHandler PPI::Format::Apache
            # PerlSetVar Colour Off
            # PerlSetVar LineNumbers Off
        </Files>

DESCRIPTION
    PPI, via PPI::Format::HTML, provides a method for converting perl source
    code into nice looking HTML.

    PPI::Format::Apache provides a convenient Apache mod_perl interface to
    hook this functionality up, automatically syntax highlighting any perl
    documents ( as specified by their extension ).

  Configuration
    It is recommended you add PPI::Format::Apache to be loaded at server
    startup, via the command

        PerlModule PPI::Format::Apache

    PPI consumes 2-3 meg of memory, and it is far better than this is done
    once and shared, rather than have every Apache child process do it
    seperately.

    The "SetHandler" and "PerlHandler" commands are as per normal for an
    Apache mod_perl handler. See the mod_perl docs for more details.

  Options
    By default, PPI::Format::Apache will show files syntax highlighted and
    with line numbers. You can set either or both of the following two
    options to turn colour or line numbers off.

        PerlSetVar Colour Off
        PerlSetVar LineNumbers Off

TO DO
    Add the ability to see the raw file
    As PPI is somewhat slow, add the ability to cache the generated HTML
